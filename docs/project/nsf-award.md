## NSF Award

RHAPSODY is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Award ID [2103986](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2103986).

### Award Details

- **Program**: Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)
- **Award Title**: "Collaborative Research: Framework: Software: RADICAL-Cybertools - A Suite of Middleware Software for Advanced Science Computing Infrastructure"
- **Award Period**: September 1, 2021 - August 31, 2026

### Project Abstract

This project aims to develop RHAPSODY as part of the RADICAL-Cybertools suite, addressing critical challenges in heterogeneous scientific workflow execution. The research focuses on creating runtime systems that can efficiently orchestrate complex workflows combining traditional HPC simulations with AI/ML workloads across diverse computing infrastructures.

### Research Objectives

1. **Heterogeneous Workflow Orchestration**: Develop runtime capabilities for seamlessly executing workflows that combine CPU-intensive simulations, GPU-accelerated AI/ML workloads, and data-intensive processing tasks.

2. **Dynamic Task Graph Management**: Create systems that can adapt workflow structures at runtime based on intermediate results, enabling more efficient resource utilization and scientific discovery.

3. **Platform Abstraction**: Build unified interfaces that abstract away the complexities of different HPC platforms, resource managers, and computing architectures.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Develop advanced scheduling and resource allocation strategies for heterogeneous computing environments.

5. **Community Adoption**: Ensure broad adoption through integration with existing workflow systems and providing comprehensive documentation and examples.

### Expected Outcomes
