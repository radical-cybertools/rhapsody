# About RHAPSODY

RHAPSODY (**R**untime for **H**eterogeneous **AP**plications, **S**ervice **O**rchestration and **DY**namism) is a cutting-edge runtime system designed to address the evolving challenges of modern scientific computing. As computational workflows become increasingly complex, combining traditional HPC simulations with AI/ML workloads, there is a critical need for systems that can efficiently orchestrate heterogeneous tasks across diverse computing resources.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a unified runtime that seamlessly bridges the gap between traditional high-performance computing and emerging AI/ML paradigms, enabling scientists to focus on their research rather than the complexities of workflow orchestration.

## Core Philosophy

RHAPSODY is built on several key principles:

### Heterogeneity as a First-Class Citizen

Modern scientific workflows are inherently heterogeneous, combining:

- Traditional HPC simulations (CPU-intensive)
- Machine learning training and inference (GPU-intensive)
- Data processing and analysis tasks
- I/O-intensive operations

RHAPSODY treats this heterogeneity as a fundamental characteristic rather than an afterthought.

### Dynamic Adaptation

Scientific workflows are rarely static. RHAPSODY supports:

- Runtime modification of task graphs based on intermediate results
- Adaptive resource allocation
- Dynamic load balancing across heterogeneous resources

### Platform Abstraction

Scientists should not need to be experts in every computing platform. RHAPSODY provides:

- Unified interfaces across different HPC systems
- Abstraction of resource manager specifics
- Portable workflow descriptions

## Technical Innovation

RHAPSODY introduces several technical innovations:

### Pluggable Backend Architecture

The system supports multiple execution backends, each optimized for different scenarios:

- **Concurrent Backend**: For shared-memory parallel execution
- **Dask Backend**: For distributed Python workloads
- **RADICAL-Pilot Backend**: For large-scale HPC execution

### AsyncFlow Integration

Full compatibility with the [AsyncFlow](https://github.com/asyncflow/asyncflow) workflow management system, providing:

- Standardized workflow descriptions
- Tool interoperability
- Community ecosystem benefits

### State-of-the-Art Monitoring

Comprehensive monitoring and introspection capabilities for:

- Real-time task execution tracking
- Performance analysis and optimization
- Fault detection and recovery

## Research Impact

RHAPSODY enables breakthrough research in numerous domains:

- **Climate Science**: Coupling atmospheric simulations with ML-based post-processing
- **Materials Science**: Integrating quantum simulations with ML property prediction
- **Computational Biology**: Combining molecular dynamics with deep learning analysis
