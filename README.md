**RHAPSODY** – **R**untime for **H**eterogeneous **AP**plications, **S**ervice **O**rchestration and **DY**namism

A unified runtime for executing **AI and HPC workloads** on supercomputing infrastructures. RHAPSODY seamlessly integrates traditional scientific computing with AI inference, enabling complex workflows that combine simulation, analysis, and machine learning.

## What RHAPSODY Offers

- **Unified AI-HPC API**: Single interface for compute tasks and AI inference
- **Multi-Backend Execution**: Run on local machines, HPC clusters ([Dragon](https://dragonhpc.github.io/dragon/doc/_build/html/index.html)), or distributed systems ([Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/))
- **Async-First Design**: Native asyncio integration for efficient task orchestration
- **Integratable Design**: RHAPSODY is designed to be integratable with existing workflows and tools such as [AsyncFlow](https://github.com/radical-cybertools/asyncflow) and [LangGraph/FlowGentic](https://github.com/stride-research/flowgentic).
- **Scale-Ready**: Scale your workload and workflows to thousands of tasks and nodes.

## Quick Example: AI-HPC Workflow

```python
import asyncio
from rhapsody.api import Session, ComputeTask, AITask
from rhapsody.backends import DragonExecutionBackendV3, DragonVllmInferenceBackend

async def main():
    # Initialize backends
    hpc_backend = await DragonExecutionBackendV3(name="hpc", num_workers=128)
    ai_backend = await DragonVllmInferenceBackend(name="vllm", model="Qwen2.5-7B")

    # Create session with multiple backends
    async with Session(backends=[hpc_backend, ai_backend]) as session:

        # HPC simulation task
        simulation = ComputeTask(
            executable="./simulate",
            arguments=["--config", "params.yaml"],
            backend=hpc_backend.name
        )

        # AI analysis task
        analysis = AITask(
            prompt="Analyze the simulation results and identify key patterns...",
            backend=ai_backend.name
        )

        # Submit and execute
        await session.submit_tasks([simulation, analysis])

        # Wait for completion (tasks are awaitable!)
        sim_result = await simulation
        ai_result = await analysis

        print(f"Simulation: {sim_result['state']}")
        print(f"AI Analysis: {ai_result['output']}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install rhapsody

# With specific backends
pip install rhapsody[dask]           # Dask distributed computing
pip install rhapsody[dragon]         # Dragon runtime (Python 3.10-3.12)

# Development
pip install rhapsody[dev]
```
