## Documentation

Full system description and usage examples are available at:
https://nnnnn.readthedocs.io/

## Code

Generally, the `main` branch reflects the RP release published on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/nnnnn/), and is considered stable:
it should work 'out of the box' for the supported backends. For a list of
supported backends, please refer to the documentation.

The `devel` branch (and any branch other than master) may not correspond to the
published documentation and, specifically, may have dependencies which need to
be resolved manually.
